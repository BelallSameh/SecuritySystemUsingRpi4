# 🔒 Security System Using Rpi4 🔒

## 🛡️ Main Idea

The **SecuritySystemUsingRpi4** project implements a sophisticated 3-step authentication system suitable for various environments such as companies, schools, and universities. This system, based on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, integrates the following authentication levels:

1. **Fingerprint Recognition**
2. **Face Mask Detection**
3. **Body Temperature Measurement**

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **🖥️ Project Code**: Complete implementation of the security system with all authentication levels
- **👤 Trained Model**: Face mask detection model trained and documented (derived from [this guide](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-face-mask-detector)), including model parameters and training accuracy
- **📚 Documentation**: Detailed documentation covering the project setup, code structure, and operational guidelines

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BelallSameh/SecuritySystemUsingRpi4.git
    cd SecuritySystemUsingRpi4
    ```

2. **Setup and Configuration**:
    - Follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation.
    - Ensure all necessary dependencies and libraries are installed on your Raspberry Pi 4.

3. **Deploy and Run**:
    - Execute the main script to initiate the security system.
    - Follow on-screen prompts for fingerprint, face mask, and body temperature authentication.

## 🌟 Features

- **Multi-Level Authentication**: Secure access using fingerprint, face mask, and temperature checks
- **Integrated Model**: Trained face mask detection model with documented parameters
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and feedback during authentication
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for setup, usage, and customization
