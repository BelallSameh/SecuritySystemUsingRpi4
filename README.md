# SecuritySystemUsingRpi4
## Main idea
The project implemented in this repository is a 3-step authentication security system that can 
be widely used in companies, schools, universities, etc.â€¦
___
- This a security system project built using raspberry pi 4 model B.
- The system is built with 3 different authentication levels:
  1. Fingerprint recognition
  2. Face mask detection
  3. Body temperature
- A fully documented code is available in the repository.
- The repository includes:
  1. Full project code with all authentication levels
  2. Trained Face mask detection model derived from the link below with all the model parameters and training accuracy.
